// Aggregator sends tasks (numbers to square) onchain, then listens for operator signed TaskResponses.
// It aggregates responses signatures, and if any of the TaskResponses reaches the QuorumThresholdPercentage for each quorum
// (currently we only use a single quorum of the ERC20Mock token), it sends the aggregated TaskResponse and signature onchain.
//
// The signature is checked in the BLSSignatureChecker.sol contract, which expects a
//
//	struct NonSignerStakesAndSignature {
//		uint32[] nonSignerQuorumBitmapIndices;
//		BN254.G1Point[] nonSignerPubkeys;
//		BN254.G1Point[] quorumApks;
//		BN254.G2Point apkG2;
//		BN254.G1Point sigma;
//		uint32[] quorumApkIndices;
//		uint32[] totalStakeIndices;
//		uint32[][] nonSignerStakeIndices; // nonSignerStakeIndices[quorumNumberIndex][nonSignerIndex]
//	}
//
// A task can only be responded onchain by having enough operators sign on it such that their stake in each quorum reaches the QuorumThresholdPercentage.
// In order to verify this onchain, the Registry contracts store the history of stakes and aggregate pubkeys (apks) for each operators and each quorum. These are
// updated everytime an operator registers or deregisters with the BLSRegistryCoordinatorWithIndices.sol contract, or calls UpdateStakes() on the StakeRegistry.sol contract,
// after having received new delegated shares or having delegated shares removed by stakers queuing withdrawals. Each of these pushes to their respective datatype array a new entry.
//
// This is true for quorumBitmaps (represent the quorums each operator is opted into), quorumApks (apks per quorum), totalStakes (total stake per quorum), and nonSignerStakes (stake per quorum per operator).
// The 4 "indices" in NonSignerStakesAndSignature basically represent the index at which to fetch their respective data, given a blockNumber at which the task was created.
// Note that different data types might have different indices, since for eg QuorumBitmaps are updated for operators registering/deregistering, but not for UpdateStakes.
// Thankfully, we have deployed a helper contract BLSOperatorStateRetriever.sol whose function getCheckSignaturesIndices() can be used to fetch the indices given a block number.
//
// The 4 other fields nonSignerPubkeys, quorumApks, apkG2, and sigma, however, must be computed individually.
// apkG2 and sigma are just the aggregated signature and pubkeys of the operators who signed the task response (aggregated over all quorums, so individual signatures might be duplicated).
// quorumApks are the G1 aggregated pubkeys of the operators who signed the task response, but one per quorum, as opposed to apkG2 which is summed over all quorums.
// nonSignerPubkeys are the G1 pubkeys of the operators who did not sign the task response, but were opted into the quorum at the blocknumber at which the task was created.
// Upon sending a task onchain (or receiving a NewTaskCreated Event if the tasks were sent by an external task generator), the aggregator can get the list of all operators opted into each quorum at that
// block number by calling the getOperatorState() function of the BLSOperatorStateRetriever.sol contract.
